- 👋 Hi there, I'm @ChrisAgianian, a Computer Science graduate from Queens College, CUNY. If you are looking for notes, I'm sorry, my dog ate them all in one big Byte!🐕
  
- 💻 I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer. I have a strong interest in full-stack web application design. My go-to language is Java, but I am also learning JS and Python.
  I recently challenged myself by attending a rigorous CUNY Software Engineering Bootcamp with a focus on Web Development. The technical training and projects were super
  interesting and taught me a lot about how to use HTML, Javascript and Pyhton to desing interactive websites, games and full-stack web apps. It was also a great opportunity
  to showcase collaboration and communication skills - which were very important for the capstone project. 
    
- 🌱 One of my most recent and exciting projects was when I made a full stack BMI calculator using HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The user would input their BMI
  information and the app would habdle calculating their BMI and then storing it into a Postgre Database using POST. My collaborative skills were also highlighted, as I worked
  on the project with a team. The entire process of connecting the front-end to the back-end, the way Flask handles routing with @app.route(), and the DOM manipulation
  aspect, were very interesting to learn.  
  
- 🔭 Fun fact about me: I am a member of the Greek Astronomy Club - Our high resolution telescope pictures were showcased in a Historical Museum Gallery!

- 💬 Ask me about my puppy, her name is Freeda.
