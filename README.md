- 👋 Hi there, I'm @ChrisAgianian, a Computer Science graduate from Queens College, CUNY. If you are looking for notes, I'm sorry, my dog ate them all in one big Byte!🐕
  
- 💻 I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer. I have a strong interest in full-stack web application design. My go-to language is Java, but I am also learning JS and Python.
  I recently challenged myself by attending a rigorous CUNY Software Engineering Career Track Boot Camp with a focus on Web Dev. The technical training and projects were super
  interesting and taught me a lot about programming, design principles, punctuality, collaboration and team work - which was very important for the capstone full-stack project. 
    
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about Genetic Algorithms - Queens College has a great course on Gen Algs and I had the opportunity to learn about the search heuristic that is inspired by
  Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution.This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to
  produce offspring of the next generation. Genetic algorithms are based on the genetic material (DNA) and the behaviour of chromosomes.
  
- 🔭 Fun fact about me: I am a member of the Greek Astronomy Club - Our high resolution telescope pictures were showcased in a Historical Museum Gallery!

- 💬 Ask me about my puppy, her name is Freeda.
